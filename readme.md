# API Gateway Design

This repository is used to design the API Gateway. It is also tied into the preview documentation at https://vendasta.stoplight.io

## Naming Conventions

- Member names SHOULD be camel-cased (i.e., wordWordWord)
- Member names SHOULD start and end with a character “a-z” (U+0061 to U+007A)
- Member names SHOULD contain only ASCII alphanumeric characters (i.e., “a-z”, “A-Z”, and “0-9”)

The resource slug, resource model code, resource type code should all be plural and nearly identical. The context ID should be prefixed to the model and type codes.

Each resource type that can be included on an endpoint should be taged on the endpoint.
