        This endpoint is used for browsers intentful navigation to service with auth by openid connect.

        Within the platform an intentful navigation must include: a partner id, a client id (which is associated with a service provider) and a service provider context (example: a specific Business Location id).

        This is the OpenID Token endpoint, used for obtaining identity (via identity token) and scoped api access (via access tokens).

        Depeding on your use case, this is called in one of a few ways based upon the grant type being used:
        1. Presenting a code that was returned to your service after user completed the `/oauth2/auth` request. 
        Scopes of identity and API access must be requested and granted. This is the `authorization_code` grant type.
        2. Presenting a signed assertion JWT, using a client key associated with your user, when acting as the service itself. Scopes are written into the signed assertion JWT or given by query parameter. This is the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` grant type.
        3. Presenting a refresh token, which acts as a secret that permits your service delegated access even when user is offline from your service. Scopes can be narrowed [but permanently?] from original request. This is the `refresh_token` grant type.

        This is the OpenID UserInfo endpoint, used for obtaining scoped identity data relating to the token's associated User.

        Requires access token scoped to at least one of the following supported scopes: `openid`, `email`, `profile`.

        `openid` or any other supported scope returns the basic user info response:
        - the `sub` field (this is the User's id)
        - the `namespace` which that User is stored within
        - the `product_navbar_data_url` which is a URL which can be used to embed Vendasta's Product Navbar in your application [reference needed].

        `profile` returns the additional following fields: name, family_name, given_name, middle_name, nickname, preferred_username, locale, and updated_at. This also returns the custom field: `roles`, which is a list of the roles associated with this User [needs relation to the APIs]. 
        Note: This scope will also return the following fields once implemented: profile, picture, website, gender, birthdate, zoneinfo.

        `email` returns the additional following fields: email and email_verified.

        Note: a legacy full-scope token is also allowed access to `profile` at this endpoint.
