# Getting Advertising Connected Accounts

A `Connected Account` represents the metadata of an advertising account that has been connected to a specific Business Location in Advertising Intelligence.  

> For info on Business Locations see the [Businesses guide](../Accounts.md)

## Setup

Create an access token with `adintel` scopes following the [Authorization guide](../../Authorization/Authorization.md).

## Examples

### Retrieving A Connected Account With ID

The ID of a connected account is composite of the following parts, separated by `:`
1. The Business Location ID
1. Provider of the account, either `google`, `facebook` or `localAds`
1. The assigned account ID
For example, an account with ID `1324354698` from Google Adwords that's connected for business `AG-X5FZQG6T25` would have its ID to be `AG-X5FZQG6T25:google:1324354698`

A connected account can be retrieved using its ID.  This data can be used to provide an overview of a single advertising account for a business when the advertising account ID is known.

### Fetching Connected Accounts For A Business

Connected accounts can be fetched for a single business location using its Business Location ID.  This data can be used to provide an overview of all advertising accounts for a business, or to fetch account stats afterwards for returned connected accounts.  The following request will fetch all advertising accounts connected to a given business.  In this case, `AG-X5FZQG6T25` has both Google and Facebook advertising accounts connected.

## Fetching Connected Accounts For Multiple Businesses

Connected accounts can be fetched for multiple businesses in order to get a high level overview of connection status for multiple businesses at once.  Accounts for multiple businesses are fetched by including multiple Business Location IDs in the request. In this example, `AG-X5FZQG6T25` has a connected Google Ads account, and `AG-X5FZQG6T25` has both Google and Facebook accounts connected.
