# Customers

A customer is an organization that has purchased a product from your organization. Organizations that have not made a purchase may be accessible as [prospects](<>).

## Common actions

### Get a list of your customers

```json http
{
  "method": "get",
  "url": "https://prod.apigateway.co/crm/customers",
  "query": {
    "filter[parent]": "me",
    "fields[crmCustomer]": "name",
    "page[limit]": 2
  },
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {your token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/vnd.api+json",
    "Accept-Encoding": "application/vnd.api+json"
  }
}
```

Will return something like 

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "crmCustomer",
      "id": "1234",
      "attributes": {

      }
    },
    {

      "id": "5642",
      "attributes": {
